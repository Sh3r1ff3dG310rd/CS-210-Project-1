# CS-210-Project-1
3-3 Project One

Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.
To stand out as a top candidate, you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

I think what I did particularly well was getting the 12-hour and 24-hour settings correct as well as the user input settings.  However, the display screen could have probably seen some improvement.  The if statements for changing the time increments on the clock I found a bit challenging, mainly because I was so new to C++, thanks to some research and tutoring help, I was able to get squared away.  The experience with this project definitely set the bar for the upcoming projects and I had the most fun with this one!

Happy Coding!
